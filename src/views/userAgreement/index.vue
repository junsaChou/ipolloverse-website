        <h3>9. Applicable Laws and Dispute Resolution </h3>
        <p>PLEASE READ THIS ARTICLE 9 CAREFULLY, AS IT INVOLVES A WAIVER OF CERTAIN RIGHTS TO BRING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING AS A CLASS ACTION.</p>
        <p>
          <b>1) Notice of Claim and Dispute Resolution Period</b>
        </p>
        <p>Please contact iPollo first.  iPollo wants to address your concerns without resorting to formal legal proceedings, if possible.  If you have a dispute with iPollo, then you should contact iPollo.  iPollo will attempt to resolve your dispute internally as soon as possible.  The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute (which discussions shall remain confidential and be subject to applicable rules protecting settlement discussions from use as evidence in any legal proceeding).
In the event the dispute cannot be resolved satisfactorily, and you wish to assert a legal claim against iPollo, then you agree to set forth the basis of such claim in writing in a “Notice of Claim,” as a form of prior notice to iPollo.  The Notice of Claim must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, (2) set forth the specific relief sought, and (3) include your iPollo Account email.  The Notice of Claim should be submitted to an email address or hyperlink provided in your correspondence with iPollo.  After you have provided the Notice of Claim to iPollo, the dispute referenced in the Notice of Claim may be submitted by either iPollo or you to arbitration in accordance with the Paragraph 2) of this Article 9, below.  For the avoidance of doubt, the submission of a dispute to iPollo for resolution internally and the delivery of a Notice of Claim to iPollo are prerequisites to commencement of an arbitration proceeding (or any other legal proceeding).  During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or iPollo shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.</p>
        <p>
          <b>2) Stipulation to Arbitrate and Governing Law</b>
        </p>
        <p>You and iPollo agree that, subject to the Paragraph 1) of this Article 9, any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and iPollo arising in connection with or relating in any way to the terms of this Agreement or to your relationship with iPollo as a User of iPollo Services (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of this Agreement) will be determined by mandatory final and binding individual (not class) arbitration.  You and iPollo further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including without limitation any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the parties’ stipulation to arbitrate, or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.  Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. <b> There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. </b>There may be more limited discovery than in court.  The arbitrator must follow the parties’ stipulation to arbitrate and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including, if applicable, attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief in favour of anyone but the parties to the arbitration.  The arbitration provisions set forth in the Article 9 of this Agreement will survive termination of this Agreement.  The arbitration shall be subject to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (“HKIAC”) under the HKIAC Administered Arbitration Rules (“HKIAC Rules”) in force when the Notice of Arbitration is submitted, as modified by the Article 9.  Unless the parties agree otherwise, there shall be only one arbitrator appointed in accordance with the HKIAC Rules.  Any arbitration will be conducted in the English language.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. <b>Judgment on any arbitral award may be given in any court having jurisdiction over the party (or over the assets of the party) against whom such an award is rendered.  Any arbitration against iPollo must be commenced by filing a request for arbitration within one (1) year, after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period.  This one year limitation period is inclusive of the internal dispute resolution procedure set forth in the Paragraph 1) of this Article 9, above.   There shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period.  </b>If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.  The party who intends to seek arbitration after the expiration of the dispute resolution period set forth above, must submit a request to the HKIAC in accordance with the HKIAC Rules.  If iPollo request arbitration against you, iPollo will give you notice at the email address or mailing address you have provided.  You agree that any notice sent to such email or mailing address provided by you shall be deemed effective for all purposes, including without limitation to determinations of adequacy of service.  It is your obligation to ensure that the email address and/or mailing address on file with iPollo is up-to-date and accurate.  The seat of the arbitration shall be Hong Kong.  The location of any in-person arbitration hearing shall be Hong Kong, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.  The terms of this Agreement (including this arbitration agreement) shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of Hong Kong.  The parties agree that the arbitration shall be kept confidential.  The existence of the arbitration, any nonpublic information provided in the arbitration, and any submissions, orders or awards made in the arbitration (together, the “Confidential Information”) shall not be disclosed to any non-party except the tribunal, the HKIAC, the parties, their counsel, and any other person necessary to the conduct of the arbitration.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent that disclosure may be required to fulfill a legal duty, protect or pursue a legal right, or enforce or challenge an award in bona fide legal proceedings.  This confidentiality provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and of any arbitration brought pursuant to this Agreement.</p>
        <p>
          <b>3) Class Action Waiver</b>
        </p>
        <p>You and iPollo agree that any claims relating to this Agreement or to your relationship with iPollo as a User of iPollo Services (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of this Agreement) shall be brought against the other party in an arbitration on an individual basis only and not as a plaintiff or class member in a purported class or representative action.  You and iPollo further agree to waive any right for such claims to be brought, heard, or arbitrated as a class, collective, representative, or private attorney general action, to the extent permissible by applicable law.  Combining or consolidating individual arbitrations into a single arbitration is not permitted without the consent of all parties, including iPollo.</p>
        <p>
          <b>4) Modifications</b>
        </p>
        <p>iPollo reserves the right to update, modify, revise, suspend, or make any future changes to the Article 9 of this Agreement regarding the parties’ stipulation to arbitrate, subject to applicable law.  You hereby consent and agree that it is your responsibility to ensure that your understanding of the Article 9 is up to date.  Subject to the applicable law, your continued use of your iPollo Account shall be deemed to be your acceptance of any modifications to the Article 9 of this Agreement regarding the parties’ stipulation to arbitrate.  You agree that if you object to the modifications to the Article 9 of this Agreement, iPollo may block access to your Account pending closure of your Account.  In such circumstances, the Agreement prior to modification shall remain in full force and effect pending closure of your Account.</p>
        <p>
          <b>5) Severability</b>
        </p>
